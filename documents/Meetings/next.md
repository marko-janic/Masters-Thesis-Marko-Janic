- When I'm training, how do I work with batches? Is the loss then just the sum of all coordinate differences if that 
makes sense
- Right now to "identify" the sub micrographs I also with each micrograph give the coordinates of the top left most 
point in the image, is this a good way to do it or would you recommend something else?
