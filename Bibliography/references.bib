    abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining the structures of large protein complexes. Picking single protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs (images) is a crucial step in reconstructing protein structures from them. However, the widely used template-based particle picking process requires some manual particle picking and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially automate particle picking, the current AI methods pick particles with low precision or low recall. The erroneously picked particles can severely reduce the quality of reconstructed protein structures, especially for the micrographs with low signal-to-noise ratio.To address these shortcomings, we devised CryoTransformer based on transformers, residual networks, and image processing techniques to accurately pick protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs. CryoTransformer was trained and tested on the largest labeled cryo-EM protein particle datasetâ€”CryoPPP. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art machine learning methods of particle picking in terms of the resolution of 3D density maps reconstructed from the picked particles as well as F1-score, and is poised to facilitate the automation of the cryo-EM protein particle picking.The source code and data for CryoTransformer are openly available at: https://github.com/jianlin-cheng/CryoTransformer.},

    abstract = {Particle picking is a time-consuming step in single-particle analysis and often requires significant interventions from users, which has become a bottleneck for future automated electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Here we report a deep learning framework, called DeepPicker, to address this problem and fill the current gaps toward a fully automated cryo-EM pipeline. DeepPicker employs a novel cross-molecule training strategy to capture common features of particles from previously-analyzed micrographs, and thus does not require any human intervention during particle picking. Tests on the recently-published cryo-EM data of three complexes have demonstrated that our deep learning based scheme can successfully accomplish the human-level particle picking process and identify a sufficient number of particles that are comparable to those picked manually by human experts. These results indicate that DeepPicker can provide a practically useful tool to significantly reduce the time and manual effort spent in single-particle analysis and thus greatly facilitate high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination. DeepPicker is released as an open-source program, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/nejyeah/DeepPicker-python.}

    abstract={Cryo-electron microscopy is a popular method for the determination of protein structures; however, identifying a sufficient number of particles for analysis can take months of manual effort. Current computational approaches find many false positives and require ad hoc postprocessing, especially for unusually shaped particles. To address these shortcomings, we develop Topaz, an efficient and accurate particle-picking pipeline using neural networks trained with a general-purpose positive-unlabeled learning method. This framework enables particle detection models to be trained with few sparsely labeled particles and no labeled negatives. Topaz retrieves many more real particles than conventional picking methods while maintaining low false-positive rates, is capable of picking challenging unusually shaped proteins (for example, small, non-globular and asymmetric particles), produces more representative particle sets and does not require post hoc curation. We demonstrate the performance of Topaz on two difficult datasets and three conventional datasets. Topaz is modular, standalone, free and open source (http://topaz.csail.mit.edu).},
