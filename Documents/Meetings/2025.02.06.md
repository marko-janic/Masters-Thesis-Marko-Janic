- Right now to "identify" the sub micrographs I also with each micrograph give the coordinates of the top left most 
point in the image, is this a good way to do it or would you recommend something else? --> Expansion with bottom right
for all orientations
  - Do the rotations and mirroring during training, because then you only need top left coordinate, transpose
- Understanding of the loss funciton rexplained
  - done, the box thing shouldnt be zero and we need to see that there is some overlap, see that model maybe also outputs width and height -> think about this later if issues with training
- We talked about different possible orientations i still ahve to implement these
  - done
- I got a bit hung up on using the lkoss function of 
  - done
- When I calculate the loss, should I do so for the coordinates in the sub_micrograph or the coordinates in the 
original image given the sub micrograph --> Prob doesn't matter
  - done
- Currently im "hard coding" the box sizes (width/heigh) in the loss funciton, I still need to fix this so it just uses
the center coordintaes. Do you think it makes sense for me to keep it in case we want to do the box loss stuff?
