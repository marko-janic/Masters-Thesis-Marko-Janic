- Show micrograph examples
  - To prevent loss use Imod or ImageIO to prevent losses
  - Use synthetic dataset as a first example
    - https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/XRTJMA#:~:text=Our%20publicly%20available%20dataset%20contains,of%20finding%20and%20classifying%20proteins.

- Micrographs look very pale, should I do some operations on them like contrast or leave it like they are
  - Maybe increase contrast later on


- So far I've been doing everything from scratch, do you think I should maybe just use the cryo transformer code?
  - For now look at the input and the output
  - Figure out how the torch model works exactly and then check what its output is.
