## Summary

## TODO
1. Find out State of the art and report
   - CryoTransformer
     - Dataset: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/cryoppp
   - CryoMAE
     - Dataset: Same as CryoTransformer, called CryoPPP
   - TOPAZ
      - CryoMAE compares itself to it
   - CrYOLO
      - Again uses EMPIAR datasets, both cryomae and cryotransformer compares themselves to this.
   - (DeepPicker)
     - Dataset: Also EMPIAR
2. How much data can you throw at Vision Transformer before it starts degrading
   - I feel like testing this will be hard since I need to throw a bunch of different datasets at the vision transformer and check its performance at every step of the way so to speak (Both with micrographs and maybe with normal pictures to see if there is some difference).
3. Research what model could be best for the model we put on top of the vision transformer
   - You mentioned I shouldnt use CNNs but isnt this exaclty kind of image recongition? Just I guess you don't have an image at the end but rather a bunhc of cooridnates.
4. Ask Heike what exactly I need for grading preparation
   - Mail was sent!
5. Start writing small report of what we've done so far.
   - TODO
