To discuss:
- Contract (!) Heike was complaining
  - TODO: Write the contract
- Details about shrec dataset
  - Particles are larger than what the ViT model accepts
    - TODO: To get the 0 projection sum over the z axis of the gradmodel.mrc ot get proj without noise
  - How do I determine the particle locations since those are given in the 3d shape coordinates
    - If you sum over the z axis then I can just ignore the z axis. Be careful what is x what is y
  - What do you think is the best way to save the "sub micrographs" since I need to know where in the original picture 
    they were since the coordinates are for those
    - You can move it to edge and get overlapping sub micrographs -> Overlapp is actually even good for training, you
     have more data, you can also transpose and (rotate) the input, make sure to adjust the ground truth particles x 
     and y when you do this, you can also flip
- Details about ViT
  - See https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/vision_transformer.py#L289
  - Patches are done automatically
  - Input image shape:  torch.Size([1, 3, 224, 224]), Default patch size:  16, Output shape after ViT:  torch.Size([1, 768])
    - First option: copy three times
    - Second option: Have normal in first, blurred in second, and very blurred in third channel, this could be an issue, needs investigation
  - Should I process the entire dataset once, save these latent representations and then use them during training or do it on the fly during training?
    - Maybe at some point we want to train the transformer so we cant do it but for now maybe, depends on how long
  - ViT expects image with three channels, do we have to adjust the model or is it fine?
    - See answer above
- Details about model
  - How should it look like, rn I just used some random linear classifier
    - yes this is fine
- Loss function
  - I still need to implement the loss function properly, should I take the one from CryoTransformer
    - use some classification loss something like binary cross entropy (BCEloss) Permuatated is imporant
    - For the permutation you should look at the cryotransformer paper and deteremine how they computer the permutation
