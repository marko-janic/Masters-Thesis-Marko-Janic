Dataset taken from: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/cryoppp\

These micrographs are all in .mrc files because this is the format biologists prefer to do their stuff in. Use mrcfile
to open them and then numpy if you want to play with them etc. These files are essentially numpy arrays. The 10005 
download might be corrupted so you should install it again
